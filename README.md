# MacroBM - A tool to run MacroBenchmarks


## Todo

- allow groups in the config, hierarchy, until "cases" is found. These are then
  used to configure the runs, the rest are namespaces
- environment variables must be handled correct
- check subcommand, that will compare the statistics against a defined
  requirement and return 0 or -1 if the requirements are met or not. usefull
  for ci

## Way later
- submit subcommand to build a database of historic data
