# MacroBM - A tool to run MacroBenchmarks


## Todo

- report subcommand -> read in raw data and give more statistical insight
- history of data, allow raw data ouput into existing file -> merging many
  versions
- gnuplot - .dat generation from history as well -> maybe even plot scripts
- allow groups in the config, hierarchy, until "cases" is found. These are then
  used to configure the runs, the rest are namespaces
- allow global overrides, that can be specialized deeper in the hierarchy
